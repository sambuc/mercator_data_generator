# Mercator Test data generator

Small tool to generate test data for Mercator, a spatial index.

## Mercator: Spatial Index

**Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the [Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu). It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/) service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.

It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.

## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit

**Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.

Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the developper to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by the specific indices provided.

This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the underlying data structure, and re-used.

## Requirements

### Software

 * Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org

## Quick start

Checkout the dependencies in the parent folder:
 * mercator_db
 * ironsea_index
 * ironsea_store
 * ironsea_table
 * ironsea_index_hashmap
 * ironsea_index_sfc_dbc
 * ironsea_table_vector
 
This tool takes as arguments a list of number of features to generate.
One thousand (1000) positions are generated per feature. For each number
provided a dataset will be generated under:
 * `number`k.spaces.json -- The reference spaces for that dataset
 * `number`k.objects.json -- The objects randomly generated (`number` features, each with 1000 positions.)

You can also specify a factor value, which will generate for each feature `factor` times features sharing the same 1000 positions.

For example:
```sh
# Generate 3 datasets, with 1k, 10k, 100k, random positions and
#  1, 10 & 100 features ids.
cargo run --release -- 1 10 100

# Generate 3 datasets, with 1k, 10k, 100k, random positions and
#  2, 20, 200 features ids.
cargo run --release -- 1 10 100 -f 2
```
